Description: Provides tools for cleaning, processing, and preparing microbiome sequencing data (e.g., 16S rRNA) for downstream analysis. Supports CSV, TXT, and 'Excel' file formats. The main function, ezclean(), automates microbiome data transformation, including format validation, transposition, numeric conversion, and metadata integration. Also ensures efficient handling of taxonomic levels, resolves duplicated taxa entries, and outputs a well-structured, analysis-ready dataset.
